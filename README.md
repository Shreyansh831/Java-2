# Java Weather API Application

This Java application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap public REST API and displays the data in a structured format. It demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests and parse JSON responses in Java.

## Features

- Fetches current weather data for a specified city.
- Displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions in a structured format.
- Allows the user to specify the city via command line arguments.
- Includes a message indicating that a certificate of completion will be issued at the end of the internship.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine (version 8 or higher recommended).
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for editing the Java code.
- An API key from OpenWeatherMap (or another weather API provider).
- The `org.json` library for JSON parsing. You can download it from [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json).

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `WeatherAPIApplication.java` file is located.
3. Add the `org.json` library to your project. You can download the JAR file and include it in your classpath.

## Configuration

1. Open the `WeatherAPIApplication.java` file.
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   javac WeatherAPIApplication.java

    Run The Programe
   java Weather API Application
